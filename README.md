# Tempate_Using_sass

Basic UI which I have designed using Figma, developed entire UI using HTML and CSS.
The main purpose of building this is to use CSS pre-processor (SASS), 

where I have used mixins for reusability of code, different variable declaration, extending CSS which is already used in some components, and many more.
